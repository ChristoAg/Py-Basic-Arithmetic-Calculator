# Py-Basic-Arithmetic-Calculator
My attempt at making a simple programme. This calculator programme will calculate numbers from these simple operations, also obeys to the rule of BODMAS. One file is a source code, another file is an executable. You can pick each of them or both. I hope that this programme show an accurate result. If you have suggestions, feel free to add me through Discord ChristoAg#1774 or send an email through my address: @christopherbackup151@gmail.com (I am truly sorry for late responses, but I will update to you soon). This programme will undergo constant updates to add features and remove errors.

ADDITIONAL NOTE:
- This calculator has 4 basic operations, in which you can input one of them to calculate the total, difference, product, and division.
- This GUI mostly reflects the calculator from mobile phones and LCD Calculators.
- You can't divide a value with 0, because it results in an error.
- At this time, there are 4 basic arithmetic operations. Will update soon as I got an idea/inspiration.
- Also, this GUI style and appearance are mediocre. I apologise for making this in a rush.
- The division result has a maximum digit of 17. It is because of irrational numbers are continuous.
- If you input a multiplication symbol(×) and a division symbol(÷), then the display will show * or / respectively instead. Otherwise the command can't calculate.
- The division result will show a float value if number is divisible by another number without remainders.
- If you input another operation after you input an operation, it will result in an error.

BASIC CALCULATOR INPUTS:
Commands and Operations:
- C (Stands for clear) = Removes operations, numbers, equations, or results from the display.
- OFF = It imitates a behaviour of a normal calculator, which means that this programme will exit as you click.
- "+" (Addition symbol) = Operation that adds between numbers. This will result in a total in the calculator display.
- "-" (Subtraction or negative symbol) = Operation that subtracts between numbers. This will result in a difference in the calculator display. Not only that, this symbol will apply into a number as a negative value.
- × (Multiplication symbol) = Operation that multiplies between numbers. This will result in a product in the calculator display.
- ÷ (Division symbol) = Operation that divides between numbers. This will result in a division in the calculator display.
- "=" (Equal symbol) = This symbol represents the result of a problem.

Numbers:
- 0 = Inputs a number, which is 0. This calculator display will show 0.
- 1 = Inputs a number, which is 1. This calculator display will show 1.
- 2 = Inputs a number, which is 2. This calculator display will show 2.
- 3 = Inputs a number, which is 3. This calculator display will show 3.
- 4 = Inputs a number, which is 4. This calculator display will show 4.
- 5 = Inputs a number, which is 5. This calculator display will show 5.
- 6 = Inputs a number, which is 6. This calculator display will show 6.
- 7 = Inputs a number, which is 7. This calculator display will show 7.
- 8 = Inputs a number, which is 8. This calculator display will show 8.
- 9 = Inputs a number, which is 9. This calculator display will show 9.

MISCELLANEOUS:
- . = Inputs a dot, it shows the decimal value of a number.
