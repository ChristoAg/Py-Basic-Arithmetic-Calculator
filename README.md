# Py-Basic-Arithmetic-Calculator
My attempt at making a simple programme. This calculator programme will calculate numbers from these simple operations, also obeys to the rule of BODMAS. One file is a source code, another file is an executable. You can pick each of them or both. I hope that this programme show an accurate result.
